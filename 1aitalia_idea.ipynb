    "## 🎯 General Description\n",
    "This project explores how LLMs can serve as intelligent career advisors by synthesizing vast information, understanding user goals, and generating personalized, actionable guidance. The goal is to build a prototype tool called Career Compass that helps users navigate career transitions, skill development, and job market trends using LLM capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike basic question-answering, this tool performs:\n",
    "- Multi-source synthesis (e.g., job descriptions, skill databases, user profiles)\n",
    "- Personalized planning (e.g., learning paths, resume feedback)\n",
    "- Conversational coaching (e.g., mock interviews, confidence building)\n",
    "- Dynamic content generation (e.g., tailored cover letters, portfolio ideas)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗺️ Project Plan\n",
    "Phase 1: Research & Scoping\n",
    "- Identify key use cases (e.g., career switch, job search, skill upgrade)\n",
    "- Analyze existing tools and gaps\n",
    "- Define target user personas\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2: Data & Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- Curate sample user profiles and job descriptions\n",
    "- Design prompt templates for:\n",
    "- Resume analysis\n",
    "- Skill gap identification\n",
    "- Learning path generation\n",
    "- Cover letter writing\n",
    "- Interview simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 3: Prototype Development\n",
    "- Build a conversational interface (e.g., web or notebook-based)\n",
    "- Integrate LLM workflows for each use case\n",
    "- Add feedback loops (e.g., user ratings, refinement prompts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation\n",
    "- Run test cases with diverse user profiles\n",
    "- Measure output quality, personalization, and usefulness\n",
    "- Collect peer feedback and iterate"
