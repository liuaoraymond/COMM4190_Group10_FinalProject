## The Loneliness Epidemic

> *"The older you get, the less friends you have"*

Maybe you get in a disagreement with a friend, you move to another country to start a career, or you simply lose touch with them. As you grow older, life sort of gets in the way of maintaining those pivotal social bonds.

### But why should that be the case? 

### Why should senior citizens be OK with staying lonely?

**📊 More than one third of people age 50 to 80 feel lonely, and nearly as many feel isolated, a national study shows.**
